// Debug build configuration overrides for faster incremental builds.
//
// WHY THESE SETTINGS:
// PhosphorSwift bundles 9,108 SVG imagesets in its Assets.xcassets.
// actool (the asset catalog compiler) processes all of them on the first
// clean build (~2-3 min). After that, incremental builds skip it unless
// DerivedData is wiped. These settings prevent unnecessary invalidation.

// Disable source indexing — biggest single win for SPM packages with large
// asset catalogs. Indexing re-walks all package sources every build.
COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE = NO

// Only build for the active simulator arch (arm64), not all slices.
// Already set in project but explicitly reinforce here.
ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH = YES

// Use DWARF without dSYM in Debug — dSYM generation is slow and not needed
// when debugging locally in the simulator.
DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT = dwarf

// No whole-module optimization in Debug — incremental per-file compilation.
SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL = -Onone

// Disable dead code stripping in Debug — not needed, saves link time.
DEAD_CODE_STRIPPING = NO
